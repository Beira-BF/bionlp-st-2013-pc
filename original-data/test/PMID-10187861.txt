Functional interactions of transforming growth factor beta-activated kinase 1 with IkappaB kinases to stimulate NF-kappaB activation. 
Several mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinases play critical roles in nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) activation. We recently reported that the overexpression of transforming growth factor-beta-activated kinase 1 (TAK1), a member of the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase family, together with its activator TAK1-binding protein 1 (TAB1) stimulates NF-kappaB activation. Here we investigated the molecular mechanism of TAK1-induced NF-kappaB activation. Dominant negative mutants of IkappaB kinase (IKK) alpha and IKKbeta inhibited TAK1-induced NF-kappaB activation. TAK1 activated IKKalpha and IKKbeta in the presence of TAB1. IKKalpha and IKKbeta were coimmunoprecipitated with TAK1 in the absence of TAB1. TAB1-induced TAK1 activation promoted the dissociation of active forms of IKKalpha and IKKbeta from active TAK1, whereas the IKK mutants remained to interact with active TAK1. Furthermore, tumor necrosis factor-alpha activated endogenous TAK1, and the kinase-negative TAK1 acted as a dominant negative inhibitor against tumor necrosis factor-alpha-induced NF-kappaB activation. These results demonstrated a novel signaling pathway to NF-kappaB activation through TAK1 in which TAK1 may act as a regulatory kinase of IKKs.
