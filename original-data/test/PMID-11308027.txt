Biosynthesis of N-acetylneuraminic acid in cells lacking UDP-N-acetylglucosamine 2-epimerase/N-acetylmannosamine kinase. 
The first two steps in mammalian biosynthesis of N-acetylneuraminic acid, an important carbohydrate moiety in biological recognition systems, are performed by the bifunctional enzyme UDP-N-acetylglucosamine 2-epimerase/N-acetylmannosamine kinase. A subclone of the human B lymphoma cell line BJA-B K20, lacking UDP-N-acetylglucosamine 2-epimerase/N-acetylmannosamine kinase mRNA as well as epimerase activity, displayed hyposialylated, functionally impaired cell surface glycoconjugates. Here we show that this cell line surprisingly still retains N-acetylmannosamine kinase activity. A gel filtration analysis of BJA-B K88 control cells, which express UDP-N-acetylglucosamine 2-epimerase/N-acetylmannosamine kinase, revealed two N-acetylmannosamine kinase activity peaks, one co-eluting with UDP-N-acetylglucosamine 2-epimerase activity and one co-eluting with N-acetylglucosamine kinase. For this enzyme previous studies already showed a ManNAc kinase activity in vitro. In contrast, the hyposialylated BJA-B K20 subclone displayed only the N-acetylmannosamine kinase peak, co-migrating with N-acetylglucosamine kinase. The CMP-N-acetylneuraminic acid content of both K88 and K20 cells and the sialylation of cell surface glycoconjugates of K20 cells could be significantly increased by supplementing the medium with N-acetylmannosamine. This N-acetylmannosamine-induced increase was drastically reduced by co-supplementation with N-acetylglucosamine only in K20 cells. We therefore propose the phosphorylation of N-acetylmannosamine as a hitherto unrecognized role of N-acetylglucosamine kinase in living cells.
