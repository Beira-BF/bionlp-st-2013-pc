Expression and properties of human liver beta-ureidopropionase. 
A cDNA encoding beta-ureidopropionase (BUP) was isolated from a human liver cDNA library, expressed in E. coli, and purified from the culture extract. The 2,006 bp cDNA contained a 1,152 bp open reading frame encoding a protein of 384 amino acids with a molecular weight of 43,165 Da. The subunit molecular weight of the enzyme expressed was about 43,000 Da. The enzyme was inhibited by 1 mM propionate, but not by 10 mM beta-alanine. Chemical analysis of the purified human BUP showed 0.54 zinc atoms per subunit, and the sequence of BUP cDNA contained one putative zinc-binding site motif. The purified enzyme had a pI of 5.65, and exhibited positive cooperativity with N-carbamoyl-beta-alanine as the substrate with a Hill coefficient 2.0. These properties of human BUP, except the inhibition by beta-alanine, were similar to the rat liver purified enzyme. Beta-alanine inhibits rats BUP activity. The complex regulatory function and the negative cooperative mechanism of BUP by beta-alanine have been observed in rats. This kind of mechanism may not exist in humans, because beta-alanine did not inhibit human BUP.
