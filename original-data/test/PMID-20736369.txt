Interaction with vascular endothelium enhances survival in primary chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells via NF-kappaB activation and de novo gene transcription. 
Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells rapidly undergo apoptosis in vitro, suggesting that the in vivo microenvironment provides crucial antiapoptotic signals. Overexpression of the antiapoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 is a hallmark of CLL, and their expression is further enhanced in the lymphoid tissues. However, the high levels of Mcl-1 found in peripheral blood samples, coupled with its short half-life, led us to hypothesize that it must be actively maintained in the peripheral circulation. Coculture of CLL cells with human vascular endothelial cells significantly enhanced tumor cell survival, an effect that was not observed with normal B cells. This was associated with elevated levels of the antiapoptotic proteins Bcl-2, Mcl-1, and Bcl-X(L) and marked increased expression of CD38 and CD49d, both of which are associated with clinically aggressive disease. Because CD38, CD49d, and some Bcl-2 family genes are transcriptional targets for NF-kappaB, we assessed NF-kappaB activation following coculture with endothelial cells. DNA binding of the NF-kappaB subunit Rel A was significantly increased and strongly correlated with changes in transcription of CD38, CD49d, BCL2, MCL1, and BCLXL, effects that were reversed by a peptide inhibitor of Rel A. These effects were not observed following coculture with nonendothelial cell lines. Therefore, CLL cells receive specific survival signals following interaction with endothelial cells mediated through the activation of NF-kappaB and the induction of downstream target genes. This type of interaction in the peripheral vasculature may explain the constitutive NF-kappaB activation and the overexpression of Bcl-2 family proteins commonly seen in this disease.
