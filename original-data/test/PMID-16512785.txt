ASK-1 (apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1) is a direct E2F target gene. 
In the present study, we show that E2Fs (E2 promoter-binding factors) regulate the expression of ASK-1 (apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1), which encodes a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase, also known as MAP3K5. Its mRNA expression is cell-cycle-regulated in human T98G cells released from serum starvation. Moreover, overexpression and RNA interference experiments support the requirement of endogenous E2F/DP (E2F dimerization partner) activity for ASK-1 expression. Characterization of the human ASK-1 promoter demonstrates that the -95/+11 region is critical for E2F-mediated up-regulation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays show that E2F1-E2F4 are bound in vivo to the ASK-1 promoter in cycling cells, probably through a non-consensus E2F-binding site located 12 bp upstream of the transcription start site. Mutation of this site completely abolishes the ASK-1 promoter response to E2Fs as well as the E2F1 binding in electrophoretic mobility-shift experiments. Our results indicate that E2Fs modulate the expression of ASK-1 and suggest that some of the cellular functions of ASK-1 may be under the control of E2F transcription factors. Moreover, the up-regulation of ASK-1 may also favour the p53-independent E2F1 apoptotic activity.
