The isolation and characterization of cDNA encoding human and rat brain inositol polyphosphate 4-phosphatase. 
Inositol polyphosphate 4-phosphatase, an enzyme of the inositol phosphate signaling pathway, catalyzes the hydrolysis of the 4-position phosphate of inositol 3,4-bisphosphate, inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphate, and phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate. The amino acid sequences of tryptic and CNBr peptides of the enzyme isolated from rat brain were determined. Degenerate oligonucleotide primers based on this sequence were used to amplify a 74-base pair polymerase chain reaction product. This product was used to isolate a 5607-base pair composite cDNA, which had an open reading frame encoding a protein with 939 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 105,588 Da. The rat brain polymerase chain reaction product was used as a probe to isolate a human brain cDNA that predicts a protein with 938 amino acids and a molecular mass of 105,710 Da. Remarkably, the human and rat proteins were 97% identical. Recombinant rat protein expressed in Escherichia coli catalyzed the hydrolysis of all three substrates of the 4-phosphatase. Northern blot hybridization indicates that the 4-phosphatase is widely expressed in rat tissues with the highest levels of expression occurring in brain, heart, and skeletal muscle. Polyclonal antiserum directed against the carboxyl terminus of the 4-phosphatase immunoprecipitated > 95% of the 4-phosphatase activity in crude homogenates of rat brain, heart, skeletal muscle, and spleen, suggesting that this enzyme accounts for the 4-phosphate activity present in rat tissues. This antiserum also immunoprecipitated the 4-phosphatase from human platelet sonicates.
