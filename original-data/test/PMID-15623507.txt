PIG-V involved in transferring the second mannose in glycosylphosphatidylinositol. 
Glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) is a glycolipid that anchors many proteins to the eukaryotic cell surface. The biosynthetic pathway of GPI is mediated by sequential additions of sugars and other components to phosphatidylinositol. Four mannoses in the GPI are transferred from dolichol-phosphate-mannose (Dol-P-Man) and are linked through different glycosidic linkages. Therefore, four Dol-P-Man-dependent mannosyltransferases, GPI-MT-I, -MT-II, -MT-III, and -MT-IV for the first, second, third, and fourth mannoses, respectively, are required for generation of GPI. GPI-MT-I (PIG-M), GPI-MT-III (PIG-B), and GPI-MT-IV (SMP3) were previously reported, but GPI-MT-II remains to be identified. Here we report the cloning of PIG-V involved in transferring the second mannose in the GPI anchor. Human PIG-V encodes a 493-amino acid, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) resident protein with eight putative transmembrane regions. Saccharomyces cerevisiae protein encoded in open reading frame YBR004c, which we termed GPI18, has 25% amino acid identity to human PIG-V. Viability of the yeast gpi18 deletion mutant was restored by human PIG-V cDNA. PIG-V has two functionally important conserved regions facing the ER lumen. Taken together, we suggest that PIG-V is the second mannosyltransferase in GPI anchor biosynthesis.
