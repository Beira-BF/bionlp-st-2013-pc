The yeast Cln3 protein is an unstable activator of Cdc28. 
The Cln3 cyclin homolog of Saccharomyces cerevisiae functions to promote cell cycle START for only a short time following its synthesis. Cln3 protein is highly unstable and is stabilized by C-terminal truncation. Cln3 binds to Cdc28, a protein kinase catalytic subunit essential for cell cycle START, and Cln3 instability requires Cdc28 activity. The long functional lifetime and the hyperactivity of C-terminally truncated Cln3 (Cln3-2) relative to those of full-length Cln3 are affected by mutations in CDC28: the functional lifetime of Cln3-2 is drastically reduced by the cdc28-13 mutation at the permissive temperature, and the cdc28-4 mutation at the permissive temperature completely blocks the function of Cln3-2 while only partially reducing the function of full-length Cln3. Thus, sequences in the C-terminal third of Cln3 might help stabilize functional Cdc28-Cln3 association, as well as decreasing the lifetime of the Cln3 protein. These and other results strongly support the idea that Cln proteins function to activate Cdc28 at START.
