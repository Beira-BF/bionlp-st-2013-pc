Adiponectin enhances IL-6 production in human synovial fibroblast via an AdipoR1 receptor, AMPK, p38, and NF-kappa B pathway. 
Articular adipose tissue is a ubiquitous component of human joints, and adiponectin is a protein hormone secreted predominantly by differentiated adipocytes and involved in energy homeostasis. We investigated the signaling pathway involved in IL-6 production caused by adiponectin in both rheumatoid arthritis synovial fibroblasts and osteoarthritis synovial fibroblasts. Rheumatoid arthritis synovial fibroblasts and osteoarthritis synovial fibroblasts expressed the AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 isoforms of the adiponectin receptor. Adiponectin caused concentration- and time-dependent increases in IL-6 production. Adiponectin-mediated IL-6 production was attenuated by AdipoR1 and 5'-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)alpha1 small interference RNA. Pretreatment with AMPK inhibitor (araA and compound C), p38 inhibitor (SB203580), NF-kappaB inhibitor, IkappaB protease inhibitor, and NF-kappaB inhibitor peptide also inhibited the potentiating action of adiponectin. Adiponectin increased the kinase activity and phosphorylation of AMPK and p38. Stimulation of synovial fibroblasts with adiponectin activated IkappaB kinase alpha/beta (IKK alpha/beta), IkappaBalpha phosphorylation, IkappaBalpha degradation, p65 phosphorylation at Ser (276), p65 and p50 translocation from the cytosol to the nucleus, and kappaB-luciferase activity. Adiponectin-mediated an increase of IKK alpha/beta activity, kappaB-luciferase activity, and p65 and p50 binding to the NF-kappaB element and was inhibited by compound C, SB203580 and AdipoR1 small interference RNA. Our results suggest that adiponectin increased IL-6 production in synovial fibroblasts via the AdipoR1 receptor/AMPK/p38/IKKalphabeta and NF-kappaB signaling pathway.
